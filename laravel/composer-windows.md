# Composer Setup on Windows

These instructions are for Window's users; [for Mac instructions on setting up Composer, go here...](/laravel/composer-mac.md)

Summary:

1. PHP from command line check
2. Installing Composer
3. Common problems (and solutions)


## PHP from command line check
In addition to running PHP on a server, you can also run PHP from command line. Composer uses PHP from command line, so we want to first get on the same page with *which* installation of PHP command line is using in order to understand what version of PHP we're using, what modules we have available, etc.

For __Windows__, we want PHP from command line to use XAMPP's installation of PHP, located at `c:\xampp\php\`

This is accomplished by adding the above paths to your PATH variable. __For complete instructions on what the PATH variable is and how to edit it, read: [PATH Variables](/command-line/path.md).__

Once you've completed the above linked instructions, you should confirm that...

1. You can run `php` from the command line.
2. The command `php` is using the PHP executable that comes installed with MAMP/XAMPP.

__Windows expectations__

```xml
$ where.exe php
C:\xampp\php\php.exe
```

```xml
$ php -v

```xml
$ php --ini

```


## Installing Composer on Windows
There's an installer for Composer on Windows, which you can download here: <https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe>.

Running through the installer, you should see the following screens.

Make sure the `php.exe` path on the **second screen** matches the same XAMPP php.exe you set up in your PATH. This way you know what `php.exe` and `php.ini` Composer is using.

When the installer is complete, **close and restart Cmder**.

Now, you should be able to run the `composer` command from within any directory. This works because the installer updated your PATH variable for you.

That's it! Composer is installed and ready to go.


## Common problems

### Issue: openssl

__Symptoms:__ You get a message saying *openssl* is not enabled.

__Solution:__ Identify what `php.ini` file you're using with this command:

	$ php --ini

Open the indicated `php.ini` file and make sure the following line is not commented out (i.e. it does *not* have a semi-colon in front of it):

	extension=php_openssl.dll
