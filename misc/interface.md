# Interface
This is not a design course so your projects do not have to be works of art, but with a little bit of attention we can create clear and easy to use interfaces.

Specifically, each project should abide by the following interface guidelines:
+ While your sub-domain and repository name may include terms like *P2* or *Project 2*, the app itself should be presented with a fitting title.
+ Every page should have a consistent header that features this title prominently at the top of the page.
+ If your app has multiple pages, each page should have the same header and it should always link back to the homepage.
+ The homepage should have a welcome/introduction to the application explaining its purpose. Design your app as it were for an outside audience. If I were to pull someone off the street and ask them to interact with your site, it should make sense to them what the purpose of the site is and how to use it.
+ There should be a consistent and logical ordering in the size/presentation of headers.
+ All links should be distinguished from regular text in some clear way (underlined, a different font color, etc.)
+ In most cases, button values should be changed from the default (i.e. `Submit`) to reinforce the action being taken (e.g. `Save changes`, `Place order`)
+ Any form inputs that are required should be labeled as such; exceptions are made for small forms where all inputs are required (e.g. a log in form)
+ Any form inputs that have non-obvious requirements should be labeled as such. For example, if a password must be at least 6 characters long, let the user know this in the form interface. Do not wait until the user has submitted the form to let them know about the requirement via your validation reporting. 
+ Always provide feedback&mdash; your interface should speak to your user, letting them know when their actions are right, wrong, or misunderstood.
+ Error messages and confirmation messages should stand out from the content of the rest of the page so they don't go unnoticed. 
    + Error messages should be some variation of red.
    + Confirmation messages should be some variation of green or blue. 
+ Any graphics/images should be of good qualityâ€” there should be no pixelated, blurry, distorted, or otherwise low quality images.
+ Layout should look presentable on laptop/desktop resolution (responsive design is welcome, but not required).
+ Copy/text should use proper English and be void of typos.
+ The interface should be clearly legible&mdash; avoid...
    + Excessively small or large font sizes.
    + Low contrast color combinations (e.g. yellow on white).
    + Garish color combinations (e.g. bright green background, red text).
